## FAQ

### Do I have to attend a workshop to complete the labs?

This site contains in-depth lab documents that complement in-person presentations. Attendance of a workshop isn't strictly required to follow along with these labs, but they are written under the assumption that you're attending a workshop and using workshop-provided hardware to complete the exercises.
