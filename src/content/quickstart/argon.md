## STEP 2: OPEN THE WEB IDE
![Image of the Web IDE](/assets/images/webide.png)

To program your Argon, open a new browser tab and go to [the Web IDE](https://build.particle.io).


{{box op="start"}}
**NOTE:**

The Web IDE is one of the ways you can write, compile, and deploy code to your Particle devices.

If you're looking for a more traditional embedded development experience, be sure to learn about [Particle Workbench], a full toolchain integration with Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

## STEP 3: LOAD THE BLINK EXAMPLE

Click on _Blink an LED_ on the left side of the page. This will load the example code to blink the LED on your Argon.

---

## STEP 4: TARGET YOUR DEVICE

Look at the bottom right of the page and ensure that the device name is the name of your new Argon.


{{box op="start"}}
**NOTE:**

If you don't see your Argon listed, click on the device name. A sidebar will appear on the left with a list of all of your devices. Click on _start_ to the left of the Argon you wish to deploy code to.
{{box op="end"}}

---

## STEP 5: COMPILE YOUR CODE AND FLASH YOUR DEVICE




Click the lightning bolt icon on the top left of your screen to flash your code to your device.

As soon as you click, the Particle Device cloud will compile the program source code to a binary file and send it over-the-air (OTA) to your Argon.

{{box op="start"}}
**NOTE:**

You'll often see words like flashing and deploying used interchangeably.
