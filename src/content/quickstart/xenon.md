## STEP 1: SET UP YOUR XENON



To set up your Xenon, click the button below and follow the onscreen instructions. The setup application will walk you through configuration of your new Xenon, register the device with your Particle account, and connect to Device Cloud.

<div  align="center">
<br />
<a href="https://setup.particle.io/"  target="_blank" class="button">SET UP YOUR XENON</a>
<br />
</div>

**NOTE:**

If you have already used the Particle Mobile App to set up your Xenon, skip to Step #2.

## STEP 2: USING THE WEB IDE
Now that your Xenon is connected to Device Cloud, you can write some code in the online Web IDE and send new code to your device to run.

To program your Xenon, open a new browser tab and go to [the Web IDE](https://build.particle.io). You will see a layout like the image below.

**NOTE:**

The Web IDE is one of the ways you can write, compile, and deploy code to your Particle devices.

If you're looking for a more traditional embedded development experience, be sure to learn about [Particle Workbench](https://www.particle.io/workbench), a full toolchain integration with Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

## STEP 3: LOAD THE BLINK EXAMPLE

Click on _Blink an LED_ on the left side of the page. This will load the example code to blink the LED on your Xenon.

---

## STEP 4: TARGET YOUR DEVICE

Look at the bottom right of the page and ensure that the device name is the name of your new Xenon.


{{box op="start"}}
**NOTE:**

If you don't see your Xenon listed, click on the device name. A sidebar will appear on the left with a list of all of your devices. Click on _start_ to the left of the Xenon you wish to deploy code to.
{{box op="end"}}

---

## STEP 5: COMPILE YOUR CODE AND FLASH YOUR DEVICE




Click the lightning bolt icon on the top left of your screen to flash your code to your device.

As soon as you click, the Particle Device cloud will compile the program source code to a binary file and send it over-the-air (OTA) to your Argon.

{{box op="start"}}
**NOTE:**

You'll often see words like flashing and deploying used interchangeably.
