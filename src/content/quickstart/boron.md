## 1. Set up your Boron

Use the online setup application to configure your new Boron. The process includes the following.
* Registration of your device with your Particle account
* Connection of your device to the Particle Device Cloud
* Particle Mesh network configuration



Once you've completed the setup you will be able to program your device and send over-the-air (OTA) updates to it.

To begin setting up your Boron, click the button below and follow the onscreen instructions. When you've completed set up, continue to Step #2.

<br />
</div>




{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed warningBox"}}
**NOTES:**</br>
1.) If you have already set up your Boron, skip to Step #2.<br /><br />
2.) During set up you may skip setting up a Particle Mesh network and use the Xenon in a standalone mode.

## 2. Open the Web IDE

To program your Boron, open a new browser tab and go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://build.particle.io">Web IDE</a>.


{{box op="start"}}
**NOTE:**

The Web IDE is one of the ways you can write, compile, and deploy code to your Particle devices.

If you're looking for a more traditional embedded development experience, be sure to learn about [Particle Workbench], a full toolchain integration with Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

## 3. Load the Blink example

Click on _Blink an LED_ on the left side of the page. This will load the example code to blink the LED on your Boron.

---

## 4. Target your device

Look at the bottom right of the page and ensure that the device name is the name of your new Boron.


{{box op="start"}}
**NOTE:**

If you don't see your Boron listed, click on the device name. A sidebar will appear on the left with a list of all of your devices. Click on _start_ to the left of the Boron you wish to deploy code to.
{{box op="end"}}

## 5. Compile your code & flash




Click the lightning bolt icon on the top left of your screen to flash your code to your device.

As soon as you click, the Particle Device cloud will compile the program source code to a binary file and send it over-the-air (OTA) to your Argon.

{{box op="start"}}
**NOTE:**

You'll often see words like flashing and deploying used interchangeably.
