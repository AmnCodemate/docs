# Quick start: Workbench

## Preview Installation

If you have not already done so, [download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Mac, Windows, or Linux. We recommend the Stable build. If you already have Visual Studio Code install you can add the Particle Workbench to your existing install.

**TODO: Add Download instructions**

Then install:

- From the **View menu**, select **Extensions**. 
- From the **...** menu select **Install from VISX**.
- Repeat for each of theme, snippets, the core last.

The core installation will take a few minutes. There's an indicator at the top of the extensions panel that shows the install is still in progress. When complete, you'll be prompted to reload. Click the **Reload Now** button.

After reload, some more components will be installed and you will be prompted to install the Particle Local Compiler. This is recommended.

That's it!
