If you're here, a Particle product must be on it's way to you! Congratulations! 

### Shipping Timing and Tracking


#### Shipping timing

Orders typically ship within 2 business days unless the items you purchased are on preorder. If your cart contains a preordered item, your entire order will not ship until all products are available. Please review the product descriptions for the shipping lead times.   

#### Tracking your package

Your order confirmation and tracking information will be sent to the email address you used to place the order. If you are having trouble finding your order, please visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io) and let us know. For order changes and cancellations, please also visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io) and let us know as soon as possible. We will do our best to change your order before it is shipped out but we cannot guarantee that we'll catch it in time.

Please note these shipping timelines are from **ship date** not **order date**. 

#### PO Boxes

Please note that for PO Boxes, there are only 2 options for shipping, Economy (for less than 1lb) and Economy+ (for over 1lb). If you need it quicker, you'll have to choose a different, non-PO Box, address since we only have 1 option with our logistic partner to ship to PO boxes.

### International Shipping

We ship to your country unless you live in Iran, Iraq, South Sudan, North Korea, Sudan, Cuba, Syria, or any country that is embargoed by the US Government. 

For international orders we only have FedEx at this time. New shipping methods are being added frequently as we work with different partners and carriers. 
- FedEx International Economy - Usually is delivered in 5 Business days or less if placed before 12pm PST
- FedEx International Priority - Usually is delivered in 3 Business days or less if placed before 12pm PST

We ship all our products from Indiana, but we have many distributors around the world (you can find a list of some our international distributors [here](https://www.particle.io/distributors).

#### Duties and Taxes

Additional fees such as VAT, import costs, duties, and taxes for international shipments are your responsibility and are not included in shipping and handling costs. Particle is not responsible for any extra charges once the original package has been shipped. If you refuse to pay these extra charges, the return shipping and any additional fees will be taken out of your refund. In the event that the extra charges exceed the value of the order, we may charge those amounts to the credit card originally used for the order.

### Return to Sender

There are lots of things that can happen in the delivery process, and packages can get held up for reasons that are outside of our control. If your order gets returned to us, we can issue you a refund or take the appropriate actions to get you a new package. 

Before you get a new package or refund, we'll need to determine the following:
- What shipping address was entered when you placed the order
- The current status of the package (for example, if it is heading back to us)
- Whether there are unpaid custom charges, fees, or burdens

If the fault lies with us or our warehouse, Particle will issue the replacement shipment as soon as possible. If you entered the wrong address, you will be responsible for reshipment costs. 

#### Invoices

We include an invoice with international orders, but sometimes packages do get held up. The customs office should contact you about this, so let us know on [support.particle.io](https://support.particle.io) if you do require any additional documentation. 

### Shipping Cost

We work hard to lower the shipping rates you see. If they are higher than you expected, there are some things you can do: 
- Consolidate shipments. It costs the same to ship 1 and 5 Photons.
- Use a slower shipping method.
- Use one of our [distributors](https://www.particle.io/distributors).

All shipping prices include a handling fee.
